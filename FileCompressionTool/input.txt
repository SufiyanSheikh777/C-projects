Compression is the process of reducing the size of data to save space or transmission time. In the context of computer science, file compression algorithms work by identifying patterns or redundancies in the original data and encoding them more efficiently. This helps in reducing storage requirements and improving data transfer speeds. There are two main types of compression: lossless and lossy. Lossless compression ensures that the original data can be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data. It is commonly used in text, source code, and other critical data. On the other hand, lossy compression discards some data to achieve higher compression ratios and is mainly used for audio, video, and images where perfect reproduction is not essential. Understanding how compression works is important for optimizing system performance, network efficiency, and overall data management strategies.
